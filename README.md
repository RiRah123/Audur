</p>

`Audur` was built by four teammates under 36 hours as part of [`HackGT 9`](https://2022.hack.gt/). The application is a web application that eases the process of sharing audio files with one another while mantaining one's anonymity. When entering the site, user can upload an audio file, providing a title and descripition with it. Following this, the audio will be stored onto the cloud supported by an Amazon EC2 instance and be given a unique identifier. A shareable link will be generated for the TinyURL API that the user can send to others.
